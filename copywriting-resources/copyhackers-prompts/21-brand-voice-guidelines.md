## Overview

This tutorial teaches marketers, copywriters, designers, and founders how to generate professional brand voice guidelines using ChatGPT 4 in approximately 2 minutes.

## Step 1: Set the Context

Instruction: Prime ChatGPT to adopt the perspective of a conversion copywriter.

Prompt to copy-paste:

```
You are a conversion copywriter, expert in decision making, persuasion,
psychology, behavioral economics, marketing, sales, UX design, customer
experience, branding, and conversion rate optimization. Pretend that you
are also highly empathetic and understand how people think and what makes
them tick. You can easily and expertly detect human behavior, thoughts,
and needs based on language.
```

## Step 2: Generate Brand Guidelines

Instruction: Ask ChatGPT to browse your website and create structured brand voice guidelines.

Prompt to copy-paste:

```
We have to prepare some slides for [URL] after having written new copy
for them. Browse the site just to get some context on the company and
product.

You're an expert on human emotions, behavior, and language. You can easily
and expertly detect personality, thoughts, subtle style and voice details,
including mimicking any voice, tone, style, jargon and sentiment of any
text. Based on the copy on the website, generate brand voice and tone
guidelines. Include the following, in this order as bullet points:

- Introduction: What are brand voice & tone guidelines, what's their
  purpose, how they help and why we're using them.
- 3 or 4 Voice & Tone Guiding principles that help bring the brand to life
- For each of the guiding principles list: What it means, How it affects
  our writing, Example copy, What not to do in the copy, and examples of
  incorrect copy.
- Vocabulary: describe the word choice so others, even non copywriters,
  can mirror it
- Tone: describe the emotion in the copy so others, even non copywriters,
  can mirror it
- Cadence: describe the rhythm of the writing so others, even non
  copywriters, can mirror it
```

## Step 3: Refine Results

Instruction: Copy-paste the generated guidelines into your presentation deck. Adjust tone if needed by requesting variations ("rewrite in a more casual/professional/fun way").
