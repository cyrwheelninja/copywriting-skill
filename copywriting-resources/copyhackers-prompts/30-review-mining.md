## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Select Reviews Based on Research Objective
Define what you're analyzing and why. Apply filters to reviews, such as date ranges, user roles, or specific sections (e.g., only "Cons" sections). Example: analyzing Dubsado invoicing software reviews from 2020 onward, focusing on pain points only.

### Step 2: Create a Master Document
Compile reviews into a single document (Google Doc, Word, or PDF). Tools like Airstory can streamline the copying process. Export as .docx or .pdf format before proceeding.

### Step 3: Handle Character Limits
ChatGPT has a 4,096-character limit per prompt. Use a free tool like ChatGPT Splitter to automatically break your document into manageable chunks. Upload your file, set chunk size, and the tool generates sequential copy-paste prompts.

### Step 4: Feed Chunks Into ChatGPT
Paste each prompt generated by the splitter into ChatGPT sequentially. ChatGPT will respond with "OK" after each chunk, confirming it has ingested the content.

### Step 5: Request Analysis
Once all chunks are processed, use the analysis prompt below.

## Primary AI Prompt

The main prompt to use:

```
The above text contains [X]. Create an aggregated list of complaints or
pain points. Sort the list in order of most common complaint to least
common complaint. Be thorough and detailed.
```

Replace [X] with context, such as: "customer reviews for invoicing software"

## Tips & Considerations

PDF Plugins: Tools like AskYourPDF exist but produce thinner, less detailed results compared to direct ChatGPT input.

Privacy & Ethics: Never paste confidential information, trade secrets, or NDAs into ChatGPT. Respect intellectual property and privacy laws.

## Use Cases

- Analyze competitor products to identify pain points for positioning
- Evaluate your own product's feedback to inform copy
- Study category-wide reviews to position disruptive products
