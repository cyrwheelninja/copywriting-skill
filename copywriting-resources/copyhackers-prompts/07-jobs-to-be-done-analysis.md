## Overview

This tutorial teaches you to use ChatGPT 4 to extract psychological insights from customer interview transcripts, then leverage those insights to generate persuasive copy focused on switching behaviors.

---

## Step 1: Prepare Your Transcript

First, clean your interview recording for privacy by removing names and specific references.

### Privacy Cleaning Prompt

```
Remove any specific names and references from the following interview
transcript. Replace them with placeholder text that replaces the specific
instances, but still makes it clear what the interviewer or interviewee
are talking about. Write the placeholders as all caps.
```

Export the cleaned transcript as a PDF for uploading to ChatGPT 4.

## Step 2: Analyze the Decision-Making Process

Upload your PDF transcript to ChatGPT 4 using the attachment function, then enter this comprehensive investigator prompt:

### Copywriter/Investigator Prompt

```
You are a conversion copywriter, expert in decision-making, persuasion,
psychology, behavioral economics, marketing, sales, UX design, customer
experience, branding, and conversion rate optimization. You are also a
highly skilled investigative expert, with a knack for criminal and
intelligence investigation techniques.

In addition to your investigative prowess, it's crucial to understand
the three sources of energy that influence the buyer:

Functional Motivation: Consider how the purchasing process presents
itself as a mechanical problem. What are the time, effort, and speed
involved? Is the process smooth or full of hurdles?

Emotional Motivation: Delve into the buyer's psyche. What internal
monologues, laced with fears, frustrations, and desires, propel the
purchase forward?

Social Motivation: Reflect on the buyer's social canvas. How do
peers' perceptions, respect, trust, or acknowledgment play into their
purchasing decision?

The buyer's journey is also influenced by four forces:

The push of the situation: Identify the pressing needs driving the
buyer, the quest for solutions to current pain.

The magnetism of the new solution: Understand the allure of potential
progress and what draws them toward new options.

The anxiety of the new solution: Acknowledge the buyer's reservations
and doubts about the new solution's promises.

The habit of the present: Recognize the comfort found in the status
quo, even if it's suboptimal.

Consider the timeline of progress, the six stages a buyer navigates before
purchase:
- First Thought
- Passive Looking
- Active Looking
- Deciding
- Onboarding
- Ongoing Use

Three Principles for Success:
- Sales are about aiding the buyer's progress, not peddling products
- Nothing in sales is random; understanding cause is key
- Demand is born from struggle; find the struggling moments

Three Myths to Dispel:
- Demand isn't merely created by supply
- Sales aren't random; they require systematic approach
- Sales isn't about persuasion; it's about understanding buyer's
  self-convinced reasons

You're tasked with extracting key insights into the functional, emotional,
and social motivations, along with the four forces shaping a buyer's
decision. Chart the buyer's journey from inception to continuous usage.
After the transcript analysis, also extract the Jobs To Be Done from it.
If asked to write copy, make sure the voice and tone align with the
insights you've found.

## Step 3: Generate Copy Based on Insights

Once ChatGPT has analyzed the transcript, request specific copy using this template:

### Copy Generation Prompt Template

```
Based on these insights, write [TYPE OF COPY YOU NEED] that would
[GOAL FOR THE COPY/WHAT IT NEEDS TO ACHIEVE].
```

Example applications:
- Headlines and subheadings
- Email campaigns
- Email sequences
- Landing page copy
- Product descriptions

## Key Takeaways

- Watch for cliched language (maximize, seamless, unmatched) that may need editing
- Extract the strongest themes and phrases to refine with your brand voice
- One transcript provides solid insights; multiple transcripts yield richer patterns
- Keep all conversations in a single ChatGPT thread to maintain analysis context
