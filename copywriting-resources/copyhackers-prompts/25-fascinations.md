## Overview

This tutorial teaches you how to use ChatGPT 3.5 to generate interesting facts about your product or service, which you can then transform into compelling "fascinations" (persuasive bullet points designed to captivate both readers and those skimming your content).

---

## Step 1: Request Interesting Facts

Prompt Template:
```
Tell me 5 of the most interesting things {appropriate preposition} {your product or service}
```

Example Used:
"Tell me 5 of the most interesting things found in the book 'How to Win Friends and Influence People' by Dale Carnegie"

Purpose: Generate a baseline list of compelling information about your offering that readers might find engaging.

---

## Step 2: Deepen the Information (Optional)

Prompt:
```
Tell me more about each of these things
```

Application: This follow-up request helps you gather richer details when the initial list needs elaboration. You can repeat this prompt multiple times until you have sufficient information to craft your fascinations.

## Step 3: Apply Fascination Formulas

Transform the AI-generated facts using established fascination formulas.

Example Result:
"A simple trick you can do to make a person feel valued and respected (it's so easy and effective, you'll be asking yourself 'Why haven't I been doing this more often?')"

Coursera Example:
From "The Science of Well-Being" course, one generated fascination read:
"The surprising thing that gets in the way in your pursuit of happiness (it's closer to you than you think)"

## Key Takeaway

This method provides a rapid workflow: use AI for fact-finding, then apply copywriting expertise to convert those facts into emotionally resonant marketing copy within approximately one minute.
