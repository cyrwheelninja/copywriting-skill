6. Repeat for all chunks until ChatGPT confirms: "OK: [CHUNK X/X]"

## Step 2: Ask ChatGPT to Analyze

### Primary Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)

```
You are an expert at sales, positioning strategy and conversion copywriting.
Out of the text you just read and memorized above, which come from a customer
interview, extract the top key insights that we can use for our positioning
strategy and value proposition copy. With each insight, provide the takeaways,
actionable steps as bullet points.

Use the following format:

- Takeaway 1: [state the takeaway]
- Action steps for takeaway 1: [state the action steps]

[More takeaways and action steps with the same format if available]
```

## Step 3: Customize for Specific Insights

The tutorial demonstrates modifying the prompt to extract objections and surprising facts:

```
[Original prompt structure, modified to request specific insight types
like objections, surprising discoveries, or pain points instead of
general takeaways]
