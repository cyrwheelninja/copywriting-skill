## Overview

This guide teaches you how to use ChatGPT to generate 50 value proposition headlines with subheads in approximately 10 minutes by leveraging actual customer feedback data.

---

## Step 1: Establish AI Role and Context

Copy-paste this prompt into ChatGPT:

```
You are a conversion copywriter, expert in decision making, persuasion,
psychology, behavioral economics, marketing, sales, UX design, customer
experience, branding, and conversion rate optimization. Pretend that you
are also highly empathetic and understand how people think and what makes
them tick. You can easily and expertly detect human behavior, thoughts,
and needs based on language.
```

## Step 2: Provide Framework and Instructions

Copy-paste this prompt:

```
I'd like you to write 50 value proposition headlines, each with its own subhead.
First, here's more info on what I mean by value proposition, pay attention,
it's important:

A great value proposition is NOT:
- A description of your product or service
- A list of features
- A list of benefits
- A mission statement
- A tag line
- A slogan
- An 'about us' section

A great value proposition IS:
- unique
- desirable
- specific
- succinct
- sticky

Three value proposition formulas you can use (but don't limit yourself):

1. The "like" formula: Like X for Y, where X is a known thing and Y is your
   new audience.
2. The "who-specific" formula: The only/best/easy X for Y, where X is your
   offer and Y is your target audience.
3. The "value-specific" formula: My product is the one that...

Next steps:

#1 I'm going to share product details. Acknowledge with 'Got it'.
#2 You will write 50 value proposition headlines each with its own subhead
   based on the criteria above.
#3 I'm going to share customer reviews (voice of customer data).
#4 You will rewrite the 50 value propositions using the customer reviews to
   infuse them with specific, vivid words. Use format: [Improved headline]
   [Improved subhead] [Exact quote used to improve and enrich the value proposition].
```

## Step 3: Share Product Information

Provide ChatGPT with basic information about your product or service, pulled from LinkedIn company pages, About sections, or marketing materials. The AI will generate initial value propositions based on this foundational information.

---

## Step 4: Inject Voice-of-Customer (VOC) Data

Share customer testimonials, reviews, or case studies with ChatGPT. The platform will then refine the 50 value propositions by incorporating real customer language, making them more authentic and compelling.

Key benefit: ChatGPT will also cite the exact quotes it used, giving you both optimized copy and contextual social proof ready for deployment.

## Real-World Results

The tutorial demonstrates results using:
- Calendly (SaaS scheduling tool)
- LMNT (ecommerce electrolytes product)

Both examples show how VOC data transforms generic propositions into vivid, customer-focused messaging.
