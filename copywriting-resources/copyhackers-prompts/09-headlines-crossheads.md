## Step 1: Prepare GPT-4 to Analyze Your Copy

Copy-Paste Prompt:

```
You are a conversion copywriter. Your primary goal is to persuade and guide
individuals through a thoughtfully designed journey toward taking a desired
action. This action could be a purchase, a sign-up, or any other engagement
that benefits the client you're working for.

Your first task is to analyze the webpage URL or copy I'll share with you.

Complete your analysis on each of the crossheads and its accompanying body
copy by answering these questions:

1. Clarity: Is the main message clear? Is the problem identifiable?
   Are technical terms explained?

2. Engagement: Is the text engaging? Does it address reader questions
   or objections?

3. Call to Action (CTA): Is the CTA clear and compelling? Are benefits
   of action clear? Is placement appropriate?

4. Persuasiveness: Is a compelling argument built? Are benefits, features,
   and social proof presented effectively?

5. Emotional Appeal: Does the text elicit emotional responses? Are
   emotional triggers used effectively?

Keep these guidelines in mind. In the next prompt, I'll paste the URL or
webpage copy for you to analyze.

## Step 2: Prompt GPT-4 to Analyze Your Copy

Copy-Paste Prompt:

```
Here is the URL/copy for you to analyze:
[ URL or paste your copy here ]
```

Note: You can either paste a live URL or paste text directly into the chat. GPT-4 may experience slowdowns when accessing websites with Browse with Bing functionality.

## Step 3: Prompt GPT-4 to Write Multiple Crosshead Versions

Copy-Paste Prompt:

```
Your second task is to give me [desired number] new version(s) for each
of the crossheads you analyzed in your first task above. Organize this
list in a table and show your thinking in a column labeled "Rationale."
```

Recommendation: Request between three to five variations per crosshead for best results. You can repeat this prompt for additional variations.

## Step 3B: If GPT-4 Misses Crossheads (First Attempt)

Copy-Paste Prompt:

```
You overlooked these crossheads:
[ type/paste the overlooked crossheads ]

Please give me [desired number] new version(s) for each of the crossheads
you analyzed in your first task above. Organize this list in a table and
show your thinking in a column labeled "Rationale."
```

## Step 3C: If GPT-4 Continues Missing Content (Second Attempt)

Copy-Paste Prompt:

```
Use the copy pasted below to give me [desired number] new version(s) for
each of the crossheads you analyzed in your first task above. Organize
this list in a table and show your thinking in a column labeled "Rationale."

[ paste webpage copy ]
```

## Key Takeaways

- Crossheads should capture attention, highlight benefits, and improve readability
- Generic crossheads like "Who we are" or "How we work" fail to drive conversions
- Testing generated variations helps identify the most compelling options
- The process typically requires 5 minutes to complete
