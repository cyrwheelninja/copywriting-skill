## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Gather Prospect Research
Compile all your research notes about the prospect in a single document (Google Doc, Evernote, etc.). This makes it easy to copy and paste into your prompt later.

Time-saving tip: Organize prospect insights as you collect them so you can quickly reference them when crafting emails.

### Step 2: Create Your Role
Define your position by answering four questions:
- Who? Who am I, the person sending this email?
- What? What did I create?
- Where? Where am I located?
- Why? Why would my offer matter to the recipient?

Once created, you can reuse this role template across multiple prospects.

### Step 3: Prompt GPT-4 to Write the Cold Email
Use the structured prompt template below, customizing tone, subject line format, and copywriting framework as needed.
