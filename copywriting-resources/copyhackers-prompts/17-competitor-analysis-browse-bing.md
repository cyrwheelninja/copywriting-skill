## Step 1: Analyze Your Homepage Copy

Setup: Enable Browse with Bing in GPT-4, then use this prompt:

```
You are a conversion copywriter. Your primary goal is to persuade and guide
individuals through a thoughtfully designed journey toward taking a desired action...

Your first job is to analyze the messaging of my homepage, [URL]. Use the
questions below to guide your answers. Tell me how effectively the homepage
communicates the unique value proposition of the product or service, resonates
with the target audience and persuades the reader to take the desired action.

Answer every single question. Show your thinking in your answers, while
highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the messaging. For every answer,
include the exact copy from the homepage you analyzed.

Use this list of questions to analyze the messaging in the copy of the homepage:

1. Understand the Target Audience:
   - Who is the copy intended for?
   - What are their needs, pain points, and desires?
   - How does the product or service address these needs and desires?

2. Clarify the Unique Value Proposition (UVP):
   - What makes the product or service unique or better than competitors?
   - Is the UVP clearly communicated in the copy?
   - Does the copy highlight the benefits of the product or service, not just features?

3. Evaluate the Headline and Call-to-Action (CTA):
   - Is the headline attention-grabbing and relevant to the target audience?
   - Does the CTA clearly state the desired action the reader should take?
   - Is the CTA compelling and persuasive?

4. Assess the Clarity and Conciseness of the Copy:
   - Is the copy easy to read and understand?
   - Does the copy use simple and straightforward language?
   - Is the copy free of jargon and technical terms?

5. Check for Emotional Appeal:
   - Does the copy connect with the reader on an emotional level?
   - Does it use storytelling or vivid imagery to create an emotional response?
   - Does the copy address the reader's aspirations or fears?

6. Analyze the Structure and Flow:
   - Is the copy logically organized with a clear beginning, middle, and end?
   - Does the copy guide the reader smoothly from one point to the next?
   - Are there clear transitions between sections or ideas?

Remember to answer every single question. Show your thinking in your answers,
while highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the messaging.

Note: If GPT cannot access the URL, use this fallback:

```
No. Complete your analysis on the copy pasted below from the [COMPANY NAME]
homepage:
[HOMEPAGE COPY]
```

product or service, resonate better with my competitor's target audience and
