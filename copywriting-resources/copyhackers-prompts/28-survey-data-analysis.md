```

[CLIENT NAME]. This is a survey that [FUNCTION OF SURVEY]. Below are the
questions, each with the possible answers and with the insight responses
can give us.

[Question 1]
[Possible responses 1]
[Insight from response 1]

[Repeat for additional questions]

Look at the spreadsheet and extract the insights with visuals/graphs/charts
where needed and applicable. Then for each survey question extract the main
finding, insight from that finding, and action step based on that insight.
```
