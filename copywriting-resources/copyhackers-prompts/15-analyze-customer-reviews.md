## Overview

This tutorial teaches how to use GPT-4 to analyze customer feedback and reviews to improve product sales copy. The method involves four sequential steps using specific AI prompts.

---

## Step 1: Data Collection

Gather these materials:
- Current sales copy for your product/service
- Feature descriptions and pricing information
- Customer feedback sources: reviews, interviews, support tickets, email communications

Pro tip: Use ChatGPT Splitter tool to manage large datasets and prevent token limits from rejecting your prompts. Alternatively, organize data in a spreadsheet before pasting into GPT.

## Step 2: Initial Data Entry (Two Prompts)

### Prompt 1 - Product Information:
```
I am selling a [SaaS app or other digital or physical product].
Below is copy on the features and descriptions of those features
and how they function, pricing tiers or packages and applicable
discounts and any other copy used to sell the product. Please wait
for further instructions; do not do anything with this data yet.

[ Your Data ]
```

### Prompt 2 - Customer Feedback:
```
Below is customer feedback data on the [SaaS app or other digital
or physical product] I am selling. Data here may include reviews
and interview and survey responses, customer service tickets or
communication by email that include comments and feature or service
requests. Please wait for further instructions; do not do anything
with this data yet.

[ Your Data ]
```

## Step 3: Organize Feedback

Prompt:
```
Please organize the reviews in a table by mood, and highlight
each user's criticisms, recommendations or feature requests
```

GPT will create a structured table categorizing sentiment and extracting key insights.

## Step 4: Generate Copy Improvement Recommendations

Prompt:
```
Please tell me how the copy selling the app can be improved,
using the reviewers' feedback

Give me recommendations on what should be highlighted in the copy,
especially from the positive reviews. For example, if a particular
feature has positive reviews but the feature isn't highlighted or
further explained in the copy, please point that out

Give me recommendations what should be better clarified, using
all the reviews, especially from the negative reviews
```

## Key Takeaway

Always take what GPT-4 generates only as way to get past the blank page. It's up to you as a pro conversion copywriter to determine what finally ends up on the sales page.

Use these prompts to identify messaging gaps and feature highlights grounded in actual customer language and concerns.
