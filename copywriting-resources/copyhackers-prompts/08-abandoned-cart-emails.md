## Overview

This tutorial teaches conversion copywriters and ecommerce marketers to use AI prompts for generating original abandoned cart email copy that stands out from generic alternatives.

## The Core AI Prompt

Copy and paste this complete prompt into ChatGPT 4:

```
You are a conversion copywriter. You understand human emotions, behavior,
and language. You are an expert in decision making, persuasion, buyer
psychology, behavioral economics, marketing, sales, UX design, customer
experience, branding, and conversion rate optimization. Pretend you are
also highly empathetic and understand how people think and what makes
them tick.

Your job is to write email copy for abandoned carts. But you will not
write boring, generic, overused email copy like "You have great taste"
or "Forgot something?" You must write specific email copy that reflects
either the retailer, industry, or brand, but in a customer-centric way
that resonates with buyers. In other words, the email copy you write
shouldn't be something any retailer of any industry can copy.

To help you do that, here is some context about the company:
[In a bullet list, paste your info about the brand, its products and
the URL here.]

Create a table with the following columns: (1) "Subject Line",
(2) "Body Copy", (3) "CTA", (4) "Rationale". (In the Rationale column,
you will explain your thinking.)

Generate 25 different outputs organized in the rows of the table.

Here are additional instructions about the email copy:
- You may use emojis in the subject line
- Mix up your approach with different humor techniques (quirky, sarcastic,
  understatement, tongue-in-cheek)
- Use casual, conversational language as if you're talking to a friend
- Don't sound like you're trying too hard
- Don't sound insecure or desperate or like a stalker
- Evoke curiosity in the reader
```

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Brand Information
Compile 3-4 sentences describing the business, including:
- What the company sells
- Their unique positioning
- Notable characteristics
- Website URL

Example: "Pacific Boarder is a Canadian west coast snowboard, surf and skate retailer known for their wide selection and decent sales and promos. Their website is https://pacificboarder.com/"

### Step 2: Enter the Prompt
Paste the complete prompt above into ChatGPT 4, replacing the bracket section with your brand information.

### Step 3: Handle Continuation
If ChatGPT pauses around row 13-14 asking whether to continue, click "Continue generating." Alternatively, reduce the request from 25 to 20 ideas to avoid interruptions.

## Key Output Framework

The AI generates a table containing:

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Subject Line | Email header copy with optional emojis |
| Body Copy | Message content |
| CTA | Call-to-action |
| Rationale | AI's explanation of creative approach |

## Key Takeaway

The magic really is in the prompt. Well-structured instructions to AI yield significantly more creative and conversion-focused results than basic requests.
