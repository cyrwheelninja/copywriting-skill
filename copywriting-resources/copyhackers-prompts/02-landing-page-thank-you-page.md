## Step 2: The AI Prompt

Copy and customize this prompt for ChatGPT-4:

```
Create a detailed thank you page that serves the dual purpose of expressing
gratitude and further engaging the audience post-conversion. Before creating
a thank you page, we need to gather some essential information to ensure the
content aligns with our strategic objectives and meets our audience's expectations.

Here's more information:

- The audience is [audience details]
- The offer that leads to the Thank you page is [offer information]
- The primary objectives for this thank you page are [e.g., lead generation,
  customer retention, brand awareness]
- After conversion, the audience expects to [receive or experience] [e.g.,
  valuable content, confirmation of action, further engagement opportunities]

With this information, proceed to create a thank you page that matches our
marketing and business objectives with our audience's expectations. Tailor
the content based on the purpose of the page, incorporating elements for each
scenario as applicable:

For Collecting Data or Segmenting List:

Incorporate a brief, friendly survey asking respondents for additional information
such as their job position, preferred contact time, recent content engagement,
current challenges, contact details for follow-up, reasons for signing up, and
their perceptions of how our service/product solves their problem.

For Confirming Registration:

If the page is for newsletter sign-up with double opt-in, include clear instructions,
possibly with screenshots or a short video, on how to confirm subscription. For
webinar sign-ups, provide direct links to add the event to their calendar for
convenience.

For Download Assistance:

Place a prominent, easy-to-find download link for any opt-in offers, ensuring
users can easily access the materials they signed up for.

Generic Elements to Include Regardless of Purpose:

- Encourage social media engagement by providing share links and asking for
  follows or subscriptions.
- Use engaging visuals to build excitement about what's next, helping users
  visualize the benefit of their decision.
- Offer incentives for recommending our service/product to others or sharing
  their experience on social media.
- Feature previous customer reviews and testimonials to reinforce the "choice
  supportive" bias and affirm the user's decision.
- Direct users to further reading by linking to articles on topics of known
  interest to them.
- Highlight any additional promotions or deals currently available.

Important Note: Maintain a singular focus for the thank you page, clearly
directing content towards achieving the primary goal post-conversion. The page
should be engaging, concise, and effectively guide the user towards the desired
action or understanding.
