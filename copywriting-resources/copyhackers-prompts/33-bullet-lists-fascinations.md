## Overview

This tutorial teaches you to use ChatGPT to generate compelling bullet points and "fascinations" from customer data like reviews, feedback, or interview transcripts.

## Step 1: Extract the Most Interesting Facts

Prompt Template:

```
Tell me {desired number} of the most interesting things about {your product
or service} from the {type of data} pasted below. Order the list based on
what quality or feature {customers or clients} want the most in {category
of your product or service} based on the {type of data} that are pasted below:

{data}
```

Purpose: Generate a ranked list of compelling product features or qualities based on actual customer feedback.

## Step 2: Get Deeper Insights

Prompt:

```
Tell me more about each of these things
```

Purpose: Expand on each item from Step 1 to gather richer detail for writing stronger copy. Repeat as needed.

## Step 3: Generate Fascinations

Prompt Template:

```
Write {desired number} bullet point fascinations using the information above.
Fascinations are intriguing, attention-grabbing statements or questions designed
to pique the reader's interest and pull them further into the content. Each
fascination bullet point makes a bold, and highly specific promise touching on
either the problem the reader wants to solve or the benefit they hope to gain.

For example, consider a sales page for a fitness program. Some fascinations
could be:

- "Discover the one exercise that burns more calories than running, swimming,
   or cycling..."
- "How to get a six-pack without doing a single crunch..."
- "Why your current workout could be damaging your metabolism..."
```

Purpose: Generate magnetic bullet points that drive reader interest and engagement.
