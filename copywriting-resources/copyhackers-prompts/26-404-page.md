## Overview

This tutorial teaches conversion copywriters and marketers how to use ChatGPT 4 to create humorous, on-brand 404 pages in 5-10 minutes.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Gather Brand Information

Collect the following materials:
- Basic company and product/service information
- Brand origin story (several paragraphs)
- Live marketing copy samples (headlines, slogans, taglines)

Source locations: About pages, Why Us pages, LinkedIn company pages, social media accounts

### Step 2: Initial ChatGPT Prompt

Start a new ChatGPT 4 thread and paste this prompt:

```
You are a conversion copywriter. Your job is to write an amazing 404 page
for a website. The 404 page should be funny. Use a self-deprecating, deadpan
tone of voice like standup comedian Jim Gaffigan. Use simple, direct language
and address the visitor as 'you.' Craft copy for three parts: the headline,
body copy, and CTA. Keep the body copy to 3 lines, and make the CTA suitable
for a button or link. Make the 404 page copy fit the brand and product
descriptions I'm about to give you. Do not provide the copy until I describe
the brand in the next prompt.
```

### Step 3: Brand Information Prompt

Copy-paste and customize this template:

```
The brand is called [name]. They make [describe product or service].
Here is their brand origin story: '[insert About page content]'
Here is a sample of their brand voice: '[insert marketing copy samples]'
```

Note: ChatGPT 4 handles up to 4,096 characters per prompt.

### Step 4: Refinement Prompts

If initial output needs improvement, use follow-up prompts like:

```
Not funny enough. Try something more witty. On a 404 page you can use puns,
sarcasm, deadpan, and cheesy language. Keep sentences shorter and less wordy.
```

Or:

```
Try something more clever, more witty, and funnier. Tap into standup comedy
techniques. An underwhelming, deadpan tone works well here.
```

## Additional Techniques

- Specify comedian styles (Jim Gaffigan, Gabriel Iglesias, Chris Rock, Jimmy Fallon, Jim Carrey)
- Request specific literary devices: "underwhelmed," "deadpan," "self-deprecating"
- Start fresh threads for different angles on humor
- Use ChatGPT 3.5 if 4 unavailable (produces less clever results but workable concepts)

## Real-World Examples

Manmade (men's underwear brand):
- Headline: "Well, this is almost as uncomfortable as a wedgie."
- Subhead: "Looks like you've ventured into the underwear drawer of the internet."
- CTA: "Return to comfort"

Dr. Squatch (soap brand):
- Headline: "You've just stumbled upon our nether regions"
- Body: "Whatever you were looking for, it's not here. Our bad! Let's get you back to decency."
- CTA: "Back Home"

## Key Takeaway

ChatGPT functions as a junior copywriter, providing workable concepts requiring minimal refinement to achieve polished, conversion-focused humor that humanizes brands.
