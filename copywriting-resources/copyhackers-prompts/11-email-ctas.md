### Prompt Template

```
You are an email conversion copywriter who has the technical skills and
psychological insight to write compelling emails that drive recipients
to take desired actions...

Your first task is to analyze the email copy pasted below. Answer the
questions below in your analysis and highlight recommendations to improve
the email copy. Organize your answers in a table and show your thinking
in a column labeled "Rationale."

- Can you tell who the target audience is for this email?
- Is there effective use of personalization?
- Does the email address pain points or interests?
- Is the message clear and easy to understand?
- Is the value proposition well articulated?
- Is the content engaging and compelling?
- Does it tell a story or use engaging techniques?
- Are the benefits clear?
- Is there a clear solution provided?
- Is the email easy to skim?
- Is the current CTA clear and compelling?
- Is the current CTA placed strategically?
- Is the current P.S. clear and compelling?
- Is the current P.S. placed strategically?

Email copy:
Email subject line: [your subject]

"Rationale." Include clickable links where appropriate.

[specify tone, voice, reading level, or other parameters]
```
