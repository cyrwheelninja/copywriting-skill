## Step 1: Initial Instructions for ChatGPT

Prompt to copy and paste:

```
Write a series of website usability testing questions. The questions will need to
help us understand whether or not our copy is hitting the mark and how we can improve it.
In particular:

- What website visitors are thinking when they land on the page
- What their first impression of the page/brand is after looking at it for 10 seconds only
- Who they think the site is for and what they think they can do there
- What is the first thing they'd want to do on the page/site
- What they expect to happen once they complete that action
- What their reaction is after completing it
- How they would go about finding out the information they need before purchasing
- What questions if any they still have after browsing the site
- How they would go about buying a specific product on the site and to walk us through the entire experience
- What they liked/didn't like about their experience
- What they would type in Google to search for a similar product/website
- 3 words they would use to describe their experience

Make sure the questions you write are not leading and unbiased.

## Step 2: Customize Questions to Your Site

Second prompt to copy and paste:

```
Now look at [website URL] and adapt the questions to this site. Then tell me what
changes you made and why. When it comes to the buying journey question, make it
specific to the site, coming up with a real product they should look for and buy
(or get as far as possible in the purchase process before they have to enter their
payment information).
```

Important: Replace [website URL] with your actual website address.
