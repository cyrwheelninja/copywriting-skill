## Overview

This tutorial teaches conversion copywriters, SaaS founders, and marketers to leverage ChatGPT for analyzing Voice of Customer (VOC) data to identify pain points and generate compelling copy ideas using the PAS (Problem-Agitation-Solution) framework.

---

## Step 1: Gather Pain-Point Data

Collect existing customer research including survey responses, interview notes, support transcripts, and review data. If you lack data, proceed to the bonus section for generating starting points.

---

## Step 2: Transform Pain Points Into Vivid Descriptions

Prompt to copy-paste:

```
What are the real world implications and consequences for [target persona]
having to deal with the following pains and problems?

[pain point list]

Expand and provide examples in vivid, descriptive detail of how they would
experience them. Write it using the second person "you".
```

This generates detailed, emotionally resonant descriptions of each pain point that capture customer experiences.

---

## Step 3: Create Journal Entry Perspectives

Prompt to copy-paste:

```
Rewrite the previous points as a journal entry from the first person
perspective of a [target persona]. Make it vivid, descriptive, and clear.
Be creative. Nobody will read the entry so they can be as brutally honest
and vulnerable as they want.
```

This generates raw, vulnerable customer narratives revealing genuine struggles.

### Optional Refinement

Prompt to copy-paste:

```
Rewrite it but don't use metaphors. Write like a human would and be direct
and descriptive.
```

Removes flowery language for more authentic customer voice.

---

## Step 4: Develop Solution-State Scenarios

Prompt to copy-paste:

```
Rewrite the journal entry but after they've been successfully using a new
[product] to solve their problems. Make it vivid, descriptive, and clear.
Be creative.
```

This creates aspirational "after" states showing desired outcomes that inform Solution copy.

---

## Bonus: Generate Pain Points Without Existing Data

Prompt to copy-paste:

```
What are the potential specific pains and problems of [target persona] in
using a [product or product category]?
```

Generates starter pain-point lists when conducting initial research is impossible.

## Key Takeaways

- Transforms raw research into emotionally compelling narratives
- Takes 5-10 minutes per persona
- Provides copy inspiration across Problem, Agitation, and Solution angles
- Works with or without existing customer data
