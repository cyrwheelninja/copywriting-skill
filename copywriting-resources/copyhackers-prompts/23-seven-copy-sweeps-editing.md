## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates using ChatGPT to systematically edit copy through the "7 copy sweeps" methodology. The process involves running your writing through seven distinct editorial lenses to enhance clarity, voice, persuasiveness, and conversion potential.

## The 7 Copy Sweeps Framework

1. Clarity - Identify unclear passages
2. Voice and Tone - Ensure consistency with brand voice
3. So What - Confirm reader benefits are explicit
4. Prove It - Verify claims include supporting evidence
5. Specificity - Add vivid, concrete details
6. Heightened Emotion - Strengthen emotional resonance
7. Zero Risk - Reduce friction near calls-to-action

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Copy
Extract and clean your copy into a plain document, removing HTML, buttons, or visual elements. Include descriptors for CTAs (e.g., "CTA: [button copy here]").

### Step 2: Establish ChatGPT's Role

Prompt to copy/paste:

```
You are a conversion copywriter, expert in decision making, persuasion,
psychology, behavioral economics, marketing, sales, UX design, customer
experience, branding, and conversion rate optimization. Pretend that you
are also highly empathetic and understand how people think and what makes
them tick.
```

### Step 3: Share Your Copy

Prompt to copy/paste:

```
Ok, we're going to look at pieces of copy and run through an editing checklist.
First here's the copy, just read it and don't do anything else until I give
you the editing checklist: [your copy here]
```

### Step 4: Provide the Editing Checklist

Complete prompt to copy/paste:

```
Step 1: Clarity Sweep
- Quickly review the copy for clarity issues.
- Highlight parts that are unclear.
- Don't make corrections while sweeping, just note problem areas.
- This should be a fast process
- Recommend edited copy and ask me to give you my edited copy.
- When I provide you with the edited copy move to the next point.

Step 2: Voice and Tone Sweep
- Check if the voice and tone of the copy remain consistent.
- Highlight areas where the tone or voice seems inconsistent or inappropriate.
- Correct these discrepancies, recommend edited copy and ask me to give you my edited copy.
- When I provide you with the edited copy move to the next point.

Step 3: So What Sweep
- Quickly review the copy to identify parts where the "so what" isn't clear
  (for every claim you have to ask "ok, so what?" and see if the copy answers
  that with deeper benefits)
- Highlight these areas.
- Review and fix the highlighted parts, then recommend edited copy.
- When I provide you with the edited copy move to the next point.

Step 4: Prove It Sweep
- Ensure that everything we claim is clearly supported with evidence or proof.
- Check for testimonials, proof bars, and other forms of supporting evidence.
- Highlight areas lacking proof.
- Recommend edited copy and ask me to give you the edited copy.

Step 5: Specificity Sweep
- Examine the copy for parts that lack specificity.
- Make sure the copy is specific enough to keep the reader engaged.
- Remove any irrelevant or boring content, then recommend edited copy.

Step 6: Heightened Emotion Sweep
- Determine if your copy evokes emotions in the reader.
- Highlight areas where emotions are lacking.
- Try to make the reader feel something, but maintain consistency.

Step 7: Zero Risk Sweep
- Examine sections near the call to action (CTA).
- Identify ways to reduce the risk of taking action (e.g., clicking a button).
- Ensure that your page builds enough trust for the reader.

General Guidelines:
- Don't aim to change your core message; focus on enhancing it.
- Believe in your copy and message.
```

### Step 5: Share Edited Copy

Prompt to copy/paste:

```
Here's the edited copy: [your copy here]
```

ChatGPT will automatically advance to the next sweep.
