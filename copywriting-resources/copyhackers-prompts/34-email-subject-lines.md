## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Request Email Subject Line Templates

```

### Step 2: Generate Subject Lines Using a Specific Template

Request subject lines based on one template from Step 1, providing email content details so the AI understands your message.

Prompt Structure:

```
Give me at least {desired number} email subject lines for {business name},
based on the {template name} template. The body of the email has {include
description of images, headers, subheads, or copy GPT needs}.
```

Key Detail: Include relevant email copy so the AI generates personalized, contextual subject lines rather than generic options.

### Step 3: Repeat with Alternative Templates

Repeat Step 2 using different templates from your original list to test multiple formulas against the same email.

Prompt Structure:
Same as Step 2, but substitute a different template name.
