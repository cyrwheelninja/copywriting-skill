## Overview

This tutorial teaches how to use ChatGPT to generate headlines based on customer pain points, which often perform well in A/B tests.

---

## Primary Prompt Template

```
You are a conversion copywriter for a new [product or product category].
One of the unique value propositions of this new [product] is that it does
not have the following pain point: [insert pain point]. Craft 50 product
headlines that make this unique value proposition clear. Assume the reader
has experienced this pain point with other products. Dig into that pain
point by alluding to their past experience and promising a better experience
with the new product. The headlines must talk to the reader directly using
'You.' Use emotion and empathy, and simple, direct language.
```

### Optional Enhancement
Add this to your prompt for more specific language incorporation:

```
Incorporate the words [specific terms from your research] and similar language.
```

### Refinement Prompts (When Results Need Adjustment)

For bland output:
```
These sound too fluffy and cheery, which makes them boring. Try sarcasm,
humor, and more concrete language.
```

For overused patterns:
```
You're using too many questions. Try again without using yes/no questions
in the headline.
```

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Identify Pain Points
Begin with voice-of-customer research to uncover specific frustrations customers experience with competitor solutions. The tutorial suggests using ChatGPT to analyze reviews quickly if time is limited.

### Step 2: Generate Initial Headlines
Use the primary prompt template, filling in your product category and specific pain point. Request approximately 50 headlines per batch.

### Step 3: Evaluate and Select
Review outputs for promising concepts. Look for phrases showing emotional resonance and clear problem-solution connections. Highlight standout language combinations.

### Step 4: Create Variations
Extract strong phrases and recombine them into new headline formats. Test multiple angles using identical concepts.

### Step 5: Refine as Needed
If outputs seem repetitive or generic, re-prompt with specific feedback about what's missing. Start fresh threads if degradation occurs.

### Step 6: Repeat for Additional Pain Points
Process multiple pain points using the same systematic approach.

## Key Tips

- Batch size: Generate approximately 50 headlines at a time for optimal sampling
- Context matters: Provide sufficient product background and pain point specificity
- Iterative refinement: Give ChatGPT feedback when patterns emerge rather than seeking perfection immediately
- Fresh starts: Beginning new threads can yield varied results from identical prompts
- Hybrid approach: Extract partial phrases rather than expecting polished final headlines
