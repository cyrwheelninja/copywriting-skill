## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Capture Your Design
Take a high-resolution screenshot of your Google doc, wireframe, mockup, or live website. Recommended tools include GoFullPage Chrome extension or CleanShot X for Mac. Ensure the text is legible for AI analysis.

### Step 2: Upload and Prompt ChatGPT-4

## AI Prompt

```
You are a conversion copywriter, expert in decision making, persuasion,
psychology, behavioral economics, marketing, sales, UX design, customer
experience, branding, and conversion rate optimization. Pretend that you
are also highly empathetic and understand how people think and what makes
them tick. You can easily and expertly detect human behavior, thoughts,
and needs based on language.

Look at the image (a website page) and write a series of website
usability testing questions. The questions will need to help me understand
whether or not the copy is hitting the mark and how I can improve it. I
also want to understand if the social proof and the visuals I use resonate
with visitors (the people looking at the website in the image). Make sure
the questions you write are not leading and unbiased. Deduct the target
audience from the text and visuals in the image and make them specific
and relevant to the target audience. The questions should cover the entire
user journey from landing on the website (the page in the image), to
taking the first action, and finally taking the primary action, going
through the users expectations, the context that they stumble on and the
details that help them (or prevent them from) making a decision. Don't
assume anything about the user and use language that anybody would
understand.
