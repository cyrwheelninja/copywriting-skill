# Copywriting Frameworks Reference

Detailed breakdown of frameworks mentioned in SKILL.md. Use when you need the full structure, not just the acronym.

## PAS - Problem, Agitate, Solution

**When to use:** Pain-point copy, emails, landing pages, ads

**Structure:**
1. Problem: State the problem your audience faces
2. Agitate: Make it worse, show consequences of not solving
3. Solution: Present your offer as the answer

**Example:**
```
[Problem] Most businesses lose leads because they take too long to follow up.

[Agitate] Every hour you wait, that lead is talking to your competitors.
By tomorrow, they've forgotten you existed.

[Solution] Our automation responds in under 60 seconds, 24/7.
You never lose another lead to slow follow-up.
```

## AIDA - Attention, Interest, Desire, Action

**When to use:** Sales pages, longer ads, video scripts

**Structure:**
1. Attention: Hook that stops the scroll
2. Interest: Build curiosity with benefits/features
3. Desire: Create emotional want (social proof, transformation)
4. Action: Clear CTA

**Example:**
```
[Attention] 73% of leads go cold because of one mistake.

[Interest] It's not your offer. It's not your price.
It's response time. Studies show leads contacted within 5 minutes
are 100x more likely to convert.

[Desire] Imagine every lead getting an instant response.
No more "sorry, went with someone else."
No more checking your phone at dinner.

## BAB - Before, After, Bridge

**When to use:** Testimonials, case studies, transformation stories

**Structure:**
1. Before: Life/situation before your solution
2. After: Life/situation after your solution
3. Bridge: How you got them there

**Example:**
```
[Before] Sarah was spending 3 hours a day manually following up with leads.
Most went cold anyway.

[After] Now she responds instantly to every lead, books calls while she sleeps,
and closed 40% more deals last quarter.

[Bridge] We set up a 3-step automation sequence that handles everything.
Took one afternoon. She hasn't touched it since.
```

## FAB - Feature, Advantage, Benefit

**When to use:** Product descriptions, feature lists, comparison pages

**Structure:**
1. Feature: What the product has/does (fact)
2. Advantage: Why that feature matters (comparison)
3. Benefit: What it means for the user (outcome)

**Example:**
```
[Feature] Automated lead response system

[Advantage] Responds 100x faster than manual follow-up

[Benefit] You never lose another lead to a competitor
who replied first
```

**Product description example:**
```
24/7 Automated Response (Feature)
→ Replies in under 60 seconds, even at 2am (Advantage)
→ Capture leads your competitors miss (Benefit)

Smart Lead Qualification (Feature)
→ Asks the right questions before you get involved (Advantage)

Calendar Integration (Feature)

```

## PASTOR - Problem, Amplify, Story, Testimony, Offer, Response

**When to use:** Long-form sales pages, webinar pitches, VSLs

**Structure:**
1. Problem: Identify the pain
2. Amplify: Make consequences vivid
3. Story: Your journey or client's journey
4. Testimony: Social proof
5. Offer: What you're selling
6. Response: CTA with urgency

**Example:**
```
[Problem] You're losing leads to slow follow-up.

[Amplify] Every lead you lose cost you $500+ to acquire.
Multiply that by 10 cold leads a week.
That's $26,000 a year walking to your competitors.

[Story] I used to check my phone constantly, terrified I'd miss a lead.
Then I built a system that handles the first response automatically.
Now I respond in seconds without lifting a finger.

[Testimony] "I went from 12% contact rate to 67% in the first month.
Closed 3 extra deals that would have gone cold." - Mike, Springfield Roofing

[Offer] The complete automation playbook: templates, workflows, and setup guide.
Everything I use to respond instantly to every lead.

## SCQA - Situation, Complication, Question, Answer

**When to use:** Case studies, proposals, executive summaries

**Structure:**
1. Situation: Current state (neutral)
2. Complication: What changed or went wrong
3. Question: The question this raises
4. Answer: Your solution

**Example:**
```
[Situation] Your marketing generates 50 leads per week.

[Complication] But your team can only call 10 per day.
By the time you reach most leads, they've gone cold.

[Question] How do you respond to every lead instantly
without hiring more people?

[Answer] Automated follow-up sequences that respond in seconds,
qualify leads, and book calls while you focus on closing.
```

## 4 U's - Headlines Only

Every headline should score on at least 2 of 4:

   - "The counterintuitive approach to..."
   - "Why [common advice] is wrong..."
   - "What [experts] won't tell you about..."

3. **Useful** - Clear benefit
   - "How to [achieve result]..."
   - "The [number] ways to..."
   - "[Number]% more [desired outcome]..."

4. **Ultra-specific** - Numbers, details, precision

   - "The 3-step process..."
   - "Exactly how [name] got [specific result]..."

**Urgency (use sparingly):**
- "Claim your spot"
- "Get started before [date]"
- "Limited to 10 spots"

## Cold Email Template

```
Subject: [Specific observation about their business]

[One sentence showing you did research]

[One sentence about the problem you solve - their pain, not your product]

[One sentence with specific result - "We helped [similar company] get [outcome]"]

[Clear CTA - one action, low commitment]

[Your name]
```

**Example:**
```
Subject: Your follow-up process

Noticed you're running Google Ads but your contact form just says "we'll be in touch."

Most of those leads are gone within an hour. They fill out 3 competitor forms too.

We helped a contractor in Springfield go from 12% contact rate to 67% by automating the first response.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if it'd work for you?
