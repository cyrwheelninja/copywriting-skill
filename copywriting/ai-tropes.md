# AI Writing Tropes to Avoid

Comprehensive list of patterns that make copy sound AI-generated. Use this as a checklist after drafting.

## Words to Remove or Replace

**Overused verbs:**
- dive into → explore, look at, cover
- leverage → use
- harness → use, apply
- unlock → get, access, discover
- empower → help, enable
- revolutionize → change, improve
- streamline → simplify, speed up
- optimize → improve
- elevate → raise, improve

**Overused adjectives:**
- robust → strong, solid
- seamless → smooth, easy
- cutting-edge → new, advanced
- game-changing → useful, effective
- holistic → complete, whole
- innovative → new, different
- dynamic → active, changing
- transformative → effective

**Overused nouns:**
- journey → process, experience
- landscape → market, space, field
- paradigm → approach, model
- synergy → (delete entirely)
- ecosystem → system, network

## Sentence Patterns to Avoid

**"It's not just X, it's Y"**
```
❌ "It's not just a tool, it's a partner"
✅ "This tool does [specific thing]"
```

**"The result? [Statement]"**
```
❌ "The result? More leads than ever."
✅ "We got 40% more leads."
```

**Rule of three without substance**
```
❌ "We're creative, smart, and passionate"
✅ [Show one quality with a specific example]
```

**Rhetorical questions that answer themselves**
```
❌ "Want more leads? Of course you do."
✅ "Here's how to get more leads."
```

**Starting with "In today's..."**
```
❌ "In today's fast-paced digital landscape..."
✅ [Just start with your point]
```

**Excessive enthusiasm**
```
❌ "We're SO excited to announce!"
✅ "Announcing [thing]."
```

## Punctuation Tells

**Em dashes everywhere**
```
❌ "Our approach — which we've refined over years — delivers results"
✅ "Our approach delivers results. We've refined it over years."
```
Use em dashes rarely. Periods and commas work fine.

**Exclamation points**
- One per page maximum
- Never in headlines
- Never more than one in a row

**Ellipses for drama**
```
❌ "And then... everything changed."
✅ "Everything changed."
```

**Setup colons overused**
```
❌ "Here's the thing: [statement]"
❌ "The reality: [statement]"
❌ "The catch: [statement]"
✅ Just make the statement. Drop the setup.
```
AI loves colons as dramatic lead-ins. One or two per piece is fine. More than that is a tell.

## Structure Tells

**Too-perfect parallelism**
```
❌ "We plan. We build. We launch. We grow."
✅ Vary your structure.
```

**Bullet points that all start the same way**
```
❌
- Increase your leads
- Increase your calls
- Increase your revenue

✅
- 40% more leads
- Calls booked automatically
- Higher close rates
```

**Every paragraph same length**
Mix short and long. One-sentence paragraphs are powerful.

## Humanizing Checklist

After generating any copy, verify:

- [ ] Contractions used (you're, we've, it's, don't)
- [ ] Sentence lengths vary (some short. Some longer with more detail.)
- [ ] Specific numbers instead of "many" or "significant"
- [ ] Real examples instead of [placeholder] brackets
- [ ] At least one unexpected word choice
- [ ] No words from the "remove" list above
- [ ] Reads naturally when spoken aloud
- [ ] Sounds like a person, not a press release

## The Aloud Test

Read your copy out loud. If you stumble, rewrite.

Signs it needs work:
- You run out of breath mid-sentence
- You'd never say this to a friend
- Words feel performative
- It sounds "written"

## Quick Fixes

**Too formal → Add contractions**
```
❌ "You will receive"
✅ "You'll get"
```

**Too vague → Add numbers**
```
❌ "Significant improvement"
✅ "40% improvement"
```

**Too generic → Add names/places**
```
❌ "One client saw results"
✅ "Sarah at Acme Corp saw results"
```

**Too long → Cut first paragraph**
Your real opening is usually paragraph 2.
