```
"I need landing page copy for my SaaS product. I have 30 G2 reviews."
```

Claude will select the right prompts and guide you through the process.

### Option 2: Browse and Choose
Check the full index to see what each prompt does:

```
Read: ~/Documents/Alexana-Projects/copywriting/copyhackers-prompts-index.md
```

Or browse the prompts directory:
```
~/Documents/Alexana-Projects/copywriting/copyhackers-prompts/
```

Each filename is numbered and descriptive:
- `03-value-propositions-50-in-10-mins.md`
- `18-cold-email.md`
- `34-email-subject-lines.md`

### Option 3: Quick Reference Table

Here's what you'll use most often:

| Need | Prompt File |
|------|-------------|
| Headlines | 03, 31 |
| Landing page | 04 |
| Cold email | 18 |
| Email subject lines | 34 |
| Product descriptions | 29 |
| Customer reviews → copy | 15, 30 |
| Edit existing copy | 23 |

## Typical Workflow

1. **Tell Claude what you need**
   ```
   "Write cold email copy for outreach to SaaS founders"
   ```

2. **Claude loads the right prompt**
   - Reads `18-cold-email.md`
   - Asks you for required inputs (target audience, offer, etc.)

3. **Provide the information**
   - Answer Claude's questions
   - Share any customer data you have

4. **Get your copy**
   - Claude generates options using the prompt
   - Runs AI trope check to remove robotic patterns
   - Delivers clean, human-sounding copy

## AI Trope Detection

The skill automatically removes AI writing patterns like:
- "Dive into", "leverage", "robust", "seamless"
- Generic openings like "In today's fast-paced world..."
- Overuse of em dashes
- Corporate buzzwords

You get human-sounding copy, not robotic fluff.

- What inputs it needs
- What output you get

## Example Prompts to Try

**Beginner:**
```
"Write me 5 headline options using customer pain points"
"Generate 10 email subject lines for my product launch"
```

**Intermediate:**
```
"Analyze these 20 customer reviews and suggest copy improvements"
"Write a cold email to [specific role] at [specific company type]"
```

**Advanced:**
```
"Create complete SaaS homepage copy. I have customer interviews and competitor analysis."
"Build an abandoned cart email sequence with 5 variations"
```

## Frameworks for Quick Tasks

For small tasks that don't need a full prompt, the skill uses copywriting frameworks:
- **PAS** (Problem, Agitate, Solution)
- **AIDA** (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)
- **BAB** (Before, After, Bridge)
- **FAB** (Features, Advantages, Benefits)
- **PASTOR** (Problem, Amplify, Story, Transformation, Offer, Response)
- **SCQA** (Situation, Complication, Question, Answer)

Just mention the framework:
```
"Write a product description using the PAS framework"
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Provide customer data** - Reviews, interviews, surveys make copy stronger
2. **Share voice examples** - Give 2-3 samples of your brand's writing
3. **Be specific** - "Write headlines for B2B SaaS" beats "Write headlines"
4. **Iterate** - Ask for variations, not just one option
5. **Use the editing prompt** - Run final copy through the 7-sweep editor
